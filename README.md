I study the structure of music and I make it easier to digest. I care about the order of notes (pitches). Right now I don't care about rhythms or timbres.

My main project is 
[rawl.rocks](https://rawl.rocks/) where I employ colored music notation so that you see chords faster. I reuse a huge collection of MIDI files available in the internet (hehe) to show the real structure of Western harmony and arrangement, zoomed into styles and composers.

I firmly believe that the best way to study the anatomy of music is by reading and analyzing tons of scores of pieces you care about. Fortunately, many scores are digitized, allowing us to create more visually ergonomic tools for this task, surpassing the clumsiness of standard notation. These tools can enhance the reading experience, making it easier to quickly identify various patterns, including harmonic, voice-leading, textural and formal elements.

My current plan is to make at an interactive introduction textbook to harmony of different composers and styles, somewhat like a sequel to https://book-one.hooktheory.com/

I eagerly need to show my current state of work to people, so let's jump into a screen-sharing call.

### Lectures

I've recorded [some lectures in Russian](https://t.me/keetezh/1055). I'd love to collaborate with designers of educational content – YouTube and TikTok creators – who wish to spread the joy of seeing structure in music. I can maybe give classes on the structure of music in your city in the UK or anywhere else - for free, if you can summon a stable nerdy audience.

### Peers

I'm an independent researcher and I do open source research for non-commercial purposes.

I gladly mentor computer science students who seek to do projects on the structure of music. Although my projects are really about music, not about technologies. Message me if you need a project to work on, although don't expect anything trendy or easy: https://github.com/vpavlenko/study-music/tree/main/research
