I study the structure of music and I make it easier to digest. I care about notes (pitches). Right now I don't care about rhythms or timbres (sounds, synths, fx).

I have two main projects now:

# Rawl

Rawl colorizes any music notation so that you see chords faster. Demo: https://rawl.rocks/

In Rawl I also try to reuse a huge collection of MIDI files available in the internet to show the real structure of Western harmony and arrangement, at scale.

If Rawl inspires you in any way, please contact me.

My current plan is to make at an interactive introduction textbook to harmony, somewhat like a sequel to https://book-one.hooktheory.com/

Abandoned demos:

- https://vpavlenko.github.io/12/

# Rokk

Rokk crunches corpora of chords to make harmonic and formal variety of music navigable. I want to make a layer of navigation on top of Ultimate-Guitar.com chords, jazz lead sheets, probably also [ChoCo](https://github.com/smashub/choco) and Hooktheory. I want to show most popular chord sequences by genre and find a visual way to show differences between styles of different composers.

It's currently on hold for me, but Pavel Zhur makes wonderful advancements on his https://p.harmonydb.com/

# Lectures

I've recorded [some lectures in Russian](https://t.me/keetezh/1055). I'd love to collaborate with designers of educational content – YouTube and TikTok creators – who wish to spread the joy of seeing structure in music. I can maybe give classes on the structure of music in your city in the UK or anywhere else - for free, if you can summon a stable nerdy audience.

# Peers

I'm an independent researcher and I do open source research for non-commercial purposes. I'm open to PhD in either music theory or music education, although I don't see how exactly that fits my current plans. I'd love to eat lunch with like-minded people: Adam Neely, 8-bit Music Theory, 12tone or Нескучный саунд. No idea how to make it happen. Lonely otherwise, happy to rent a room at your share house.

I gladly mentor computer science students who seek to do projects on the structure of music. Message me if you need a project to work on.
