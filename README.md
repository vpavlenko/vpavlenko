I research the structure of music and I make it easier to digest. I care about notes (pitches). Right now I don't care about rhythms or timbres (sounds, synths, fx).

I have two main projects now:

# Rawl

Rawl adds colors to any music notation to make you see harmonic patterns faster. Demo: https://rawl.rocks/

In Rawl I also try to reuse a huge collection of MIDI files available in the internet to show the real structure of Western harmony and arrangement, at scale.

If Rawl inspires you in any way, please contact me.

Abandoned demos:

# Rokk

Rokk crunches corpora of chords to make harmonic and formal variety of music navigable. I want to make a layer of navigation on top of Ultimate-Guitar.com chords, jazz lead sheets, probably also [ChoCo](https://github.com/smashub/choco) and Hooktheory. I want to show most popular chord sequences by genre and find a visual way to show differences between styles of different composers.

# Lectures

I've recorded [some lectures in Russian](https://t.me/keetezh/1055). I'd love to collaborate with designers of educational content – YouTube and TikTok creators – who wish to spread the joy of seeing structure in music. I can maybe give classes on the structure of music in your city in the UK.

# Academia

I'm an independent researcher and I do open source research for non-commercial purposes. I'm open to PhD.

I also mentor computer science students who seek to do projects on the structure of music. Message me if you need a project to work on.
