I study and visualize music theory. I make an interactive course on Western music theory: https://rawl.rocks/. Sometimes I record [lectures in Russian](https://t.me/keetezh/1055). I may have ideas to explore, DM to do research together

I explain what I do here: https://twitter.com/vitalypavlenko/status/1771820942680830417

I'm happy to give an intensive course on visual approach to the structure of Western music at your hackerspace, for free, if you're in a visa-free country :)
